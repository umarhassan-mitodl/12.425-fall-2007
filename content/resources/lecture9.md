description: 'Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is
  to review the concepts related to planet interior compositions, discuss the ambiguities
  associated with predicting planetary and exo-planetary internal structure. A second
  goal is to understand the uncertainties in these predictions based on two assumptions:
  the body has a uniform material phase; the body has a uniform temperature.'

Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to review the concepts related to planet interior compositions, discuss the ambiguities associated with predicting planetary and exo-planetary internal structure. A second goal is to understand the uncertainties in these predictions based on two assumptions: the body has a uniform material phase; the body has a uniform temperature.
