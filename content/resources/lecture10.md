description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to
  study and discuss exoplanet secondary eclipse light curves, review blackbody radiation,
  and determine how star?s and planet?s temperatures can be defined by the black body
  radiation curves. Students will define temperature and assess exoplanet temperature
  data reported in the news.
