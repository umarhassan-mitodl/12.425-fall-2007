description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to
  discuss solar system planetary spectra. Students will become familiar with the equation
  of radiative transfer and one solution to that equation. They will also estimate
  transmission spectra flux ratios and the exoplanet transmission spectra and/or photometry.
