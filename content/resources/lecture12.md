description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to
  discuss direct imaging of extrasolar planets. Students will become familiar with
  direct-imaging planet candidates, understand what is being measured when imaging
  the objects, and review the planet-star flux ratio with a wrap-up summary of how
  scientists are planning to use the direct-imaging technique to search for extrasolar
  Earth-twins.
